# Update June 2022

This research is complete - see [results](results) for more info!

# Update Nov 2021

This survey is complete and currently in analysis and write-up phases. You can see interim result reporting at my [Data for Policy 2021 talk page](https://covid19-data-sharing-study.github.io/results/data-for-policy-2021)

# Update July 2021

After a long period of struggling to recruit, I've managed to get an amendedment from my ethics board allowing me to invite people directly to participate, so I'm giving this study a bit of an additional push. This also will give us the chance to see if subsequent waves have any differences compared to wave one, when this study was launched.

#  Original post

Hi folks! I'm researching attitudes and challenges in COVID-19 related data access and data sharing, from a biology/bioinformatics research software engineer perspective.

My research question will explore:

> In times of a pandemic or epidemic when rapid response is required, what are attitudes towards pathogen-related data sharing and data access? In particular:

  - Are these data licenced in a way that permits re-use and redistribution?
  - Are they made available in ways that are easy to download and re-use, e.g. API or bulk download, machine-readable with relevant metadata?
  - What response do various communities have to these restrictions?

## Scope

Data types I am interested in: Data that have no strong ethical reasons to keep private, such as virus omics data and infection/death/recovery rates by geographic region.

Data that are out of scope: all private data that can not be shared easily, such as clinical personal data, including host omics data (e.g. human genomic data as opposed to virus sequence data), location data, and contact tracing.
